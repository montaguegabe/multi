"""Install the Multi agent skills.

``multi skills install`` copies the published skills with the skills.sh
installer (``npx skills add``). ``--dev`` instead runs the skills repo's own
``scripts/install-dev.sh``, which symlinks the checked-out skills into
``~/.agents/skills`` and ``~/.claude/skills`` so edits are live for Codex and
Claude Code. The symlink logic lives in that script, shared by every skills
repo made from the BoilerSync ``skills`` template; this command only finds the
repo and runs it.
